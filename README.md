version_4 of the Project_1_quadtree

In this version, two files are added in to the code, 'destory.h' and 'destory.c'.

In these files, the implementation of function named destory_tree() is completed, which could recursively remove all the nodes of the tree. To be more specificly, the leaf node will be removed first, and the root will be done at the end.
